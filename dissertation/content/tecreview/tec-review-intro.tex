We start with some research about the best technologies that can be used to develop the system. The technologies that we need are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Backend programming language.
	\item  Communication interface.
	\item  Databases for each service.
	\item  How to store images
	\item  Client technologies.
	\item  How and where run the services.
\end{itemize}



We have used the criteria described in \ref{sel:criteria} for deciding the technologies.
