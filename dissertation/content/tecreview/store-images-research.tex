We have considered a few ways to store the images.


\begin{itemize}
	\item Store image in MongoDB using Gridsfs https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/gridfs/
	
	\item Store images in MySQL database using binary blobs. 
	
	\item  Store in the file system and store URL in a database.
\end{itemize}


The best way to store the images is to use the file system and store the URL in another database, because:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Fewer data need to be transferred. If we store the image in a database, it would need to be retrieved from the database and then sent to the user. So the service will need to deal with a huge amount of data. If we just store the URL and allow the user to access the file system, the service will need to deal with a much lower amount of data. Resulting in better performance.
	
	\item Much easier to escalate. More buckets can be easily added, and the amount of data store in the database is meager and can be stored in a very simple way, just as single tables without the need to join data.
	
	\item Internet services providers(Google Cloud, Azure, and AWS) supply ready to use file systems that can have public access: buckets. They are cheap, have high performance, and are scalable.
\end{itemize}

To store the URL, we have decided to use a relational database because we need to access the data using keys.
